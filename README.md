# Pet Weather App
Make sure Node.js and NPM are up to date.  If not, then run the following:

Get the latest node.js (to keep ng2 CLI happy).

> `nvm install node`

> `nvm use 7.5.0` or whichever is the latest at the time.

Update npm.

> `npm install -g npm`

Then run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Development server
Run `ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --live-reload-port 8081` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.  If you need to change ports and such, use `ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --live-reload-port 8081` and then navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` to view the site.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
